# Nimex
A very small script for windows(actually created for personal use) to run Nim programs like a script.nimex actually compiles the program in silent mode and execute it,after which the executable is deleted.
### Usage:
```
Nimex yourprogram.nim
```
linux users can use [nimrun](https://github.com/flaviut/nimrun)
### Note:
Nimex should be in same directory as the .nim file.

### Alternatives:
[nimrun](https://github.com/flaviut/nimrun) :A small tool to run nim files as executables without explicitly invoking the compiler

[nimr](https://github.com/Jeff-Ciesielski/nimr) : Run nim programs like scripts
